# scenefx

wlroots is the de-facto library for building wayland compositors, and its scene api is a great stride in simplifying wayland compositor development. The problem with the scene api (for compositors looking for eye candy), however, is that it forces you to use the wlr renderer, which is powerful yet simple. SceneFX is a project that takes the scene api and replaces the wlr renderer with our own fx renderer, capable of rendering surfaces with eye-candy effects including blur, shadows, and rounded corners, while maintaining the benefits of simplicity gained from using the scene api.

**Please note: while SceneFX is in use by SwayFX version 0.4, it is not yet ready for usage by other compositors. Please refer to the [1.0 milestone](https://github.com/wlrfx/scenefx/milestone/2) to track the remaining tasks for our stable 1.0 release**

## Installation
<a href="https://repology.org/project/scenefx/versions"><img src="https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/scenefx.svg"/></a>


## Compiling From Source
Install dependencies:
* meson \*
* wlroots
* wayland
* wayland-protocols \*
* EGL and GLESv2
* libdrm
* pixman

_\* Compile-time dep_

Run these commands:
```sh
meson setup build/
ninja -C build/
```

Install like so:
```sh
sudo ninja -C build/ install
```

## Debugging

SceneFX includes the same debugging tools and environment variables as upstream wlroots does, but with some extra goodies.

### Environment variables:

- `WLR_RENDERER_ALLOW_SOFTWARE=1`: Use software rendering
- `WLR_SCENE_DEBUG_DAMAGE=rerender`: Re-render the whole display on each commit (don't use damage)
- `WLR_SCENE_DEBUG_DAMAGE=highlight`: Highlights where damage has occurred (where SwayFX get's re-rendered)
- `WLR_SCENE_DISABLE_DIRECT_SCANOUT=1`: Disable direct scanout (always composites, even fullscreen windows)
- `WLR_SCENE_DISABLE_VISIBILITY=1`: Disables culling of non-visible regions of a window/buffer (an example would be a small window fully covered by an opaque window)
- `WLR_SCENE_HIGHLIGHT_TRANSPARENT_REGION=1`: Highlights the transparent areas of a window/buffer
- `WLR_EGL_NO_MODIFIERS=1`: Disables modifiers for EGL

### Tracy profiling

Optional [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) profiling can be enabled for an extra good view of when and what is happening.

#### Enabling:

Note: These instructions will enable basic profiling

1. Add SceneFX as a subproject to your compositor
2. Import it as a subproject dependency
3. Run `meson subprojects download` to download the tracy project into the subproject directory
4. Compile SceneFX with `-Dtracy_enable=true` (and `--buildtype=debugoptimized` if using meson).
5. Start your compositor
6. Start the `tracy-profiler` and connect to the running compositor (The version of the profiler should not matter, but if any issues are encountered, try using a version that matches the subproject).

To enable more advanced profiling, the compositor in question needs to be run by the root user which comes with its own drawbacks, like DBus not working out of the box. A recommended way of doing this is by running your compositor with the `-E` sudo flag, such as `sudo -E sway`.

To enable DBus, you need to give the root user access to the DBus session bus by adding the following lines to the `/etc/dbus-1/session-local.conf` file (you might have to create said file), and reboot your system.

```xml
<!-- /etc/dbus-1/session-local.conf -->
<!-- Allow root to access session bus -->
<busconfig>
  <policy context="mandatory">
    <allow user="root"/>
  </policy>
</busconfig>
```
